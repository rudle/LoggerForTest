# LoggerForTest

LoggerForTest is a [Logger](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.2/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) API compatible logger that lets you inspect the contents of a log
without hitting the disk. You probably want to replace the `Logger` constant in your app with this in your `spec_helper.rb`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'logger_for_test'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install logger_for_test
